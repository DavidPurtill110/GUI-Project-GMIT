# GUI-Project-GMIT
Emil, Im working on this for the next 2 days, have been busy with work. David has done lots of work but has added a new project instead. I will have a look to see what is going on, maybe try to add it properly to the main file. He will look at it this afternoon. Im going ot go fully through it this afternoon to make sure we are not missing anything.  You have done loads, thanks.
